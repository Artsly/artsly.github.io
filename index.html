Hello World! Artsly is a program that randomly generates a prompt for artists (of all mediums). All prompts are hardcoded into the program, and for now the database of prompts is inside main.py, as such all contributions to the database of prompts has got to fit the formatting of the python files.
<br>
The program is planned to be piped into a website, but at the moment, it is only accessible through the python file; to run:
<br>		
	<code>
		$ git clone https://github.com/artsly/Artsly
		$ cd Artsly
	</code>
<br>
		From there, open the main.py file in your ide of choice then run it.
